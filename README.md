# []() Presentation Layer Architecture patter is MVi and Clean Architecute 

## []()UI Controllers

are activities or fragments. The only job of UI controllers is to know how to display data and pass on UI events, such as the user pressing a button. UI Controllers neither contain the UI data, nor directly manipulate data.

## []()Repository
This class is the single source of truth for all of our app's data and acts as a clean API for the UI to communicate with . Presenter simply request data usecase then it request it to repository. They do not need to worry about whether the repository should load from the database or network, or how or when to persist the data. The repository manages all of this. As part of this responsibility, the repository is a mediator between the different data sources.

## []()Remote Network Data Source

Manages data from a remote data source, such as the internet.


## []()Local Database Data Source

Manages data from a local data source, such as SharedPreference.
